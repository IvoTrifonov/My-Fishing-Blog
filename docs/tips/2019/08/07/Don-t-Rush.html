<p>Whenever I go fishing, I’m champing at the bit to hit the water – nigh on running. This is a bad approach when fishing the ocean rocks. Firstly, moving hastily across a slippery uneven surface is a recipe for disaster. Take it easy and focus on sure footing. Secondly, and most importantly. Take 20 minutes and observe the spot you’re about to fish.</p>
