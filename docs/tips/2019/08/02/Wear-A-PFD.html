<p>Fishing the ocean rocks is exciting and incredibly rewarding. It can also be very deadly. We lose so many anglers unnecessarily because of poor decisions made while fishing the ocean rocks. Wear a PFD, (personal floatation device). There are plenty of great designs that allow you to move about and fish unencumbered. It may well save your life.</p>
