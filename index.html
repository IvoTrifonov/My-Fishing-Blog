            <p>Spin fishing is an angling technique where a spinning lure is used to entice the fish to bite. Spin
                fishing is used in both freshwater and marine environments. Spin fishing is distinguished between fly
                fishing and bait cast fishing by the type of rod and reel used. There are two types of reels used when
                spin fishing, the open faced reel and the closed faced reel. The spin fishing rod has no trigger
                attached to the base of the fishing rod. This is what differentiates the spin fishing rod from the bait
                casting fishing rod.</p>

            <p>Fly fishing is an angling method that uses a light-weight lure—called an artificial fly—to catch fish.
                The fly is cast using a fly rod, reel, and specialized weighted line. The light weight requires casting
                techniques significantly different from other forms of casting. The flies may resemble natural
                invertebrates, baitfish, or other food organisms.</p>

            <p>Carp is a common name for various species of freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae, a very large group
                of fish native to Europe and Asia. They have been introduced to various locations around the world,
                though with mixed results.</p>
