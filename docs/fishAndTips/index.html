                <p class="content"><p>You can get great fishing gear prices online. However, so much about fishing is feel, and feel is X-factor, subjective and difficult to put into words. Before you lash out on a major tackle purchase, head to a tackle shop first and check it out – feel it. Talk to a professional.</p>

                <h4>Check For Quality Assurance</h4>
                <p class="date">10 Aug 2019</p>
                <p class="content"><p>Check the warranties. So many anglers fail to do this and get burned. A lengthy, all-inclusive replacement warranty is a sign that the manufacturer stands by the endurance and quality of their products. You will sometimes find the less prominent brands offer great warranties. It’s definitely worth checking out their products.</p>

                <p class="content"><p>Never fish the ocean rocks alone. Again, this is a mistake many experienced anglers make. Tell people exactly where you are going and when you will return. Always try and return when you say you will. If you move spots, call someone and let them know, send a text, it takes no time at all. Remember, fishing the ocean rocks claims many lives every year. These simple precautions are a must as they will likely save your life.</p>

                <p class="content"><p>Whenever I go fishing, I’m champing at the bit to hit the water – nigh on running. This is a bad approach when fishing the ocean rocks. Firstly, moving hastily across a slippery uneven surface is a recipe for disaster. Take it easy and focus on sure footing. Secondly, and most importantly. Take 20 minutes and observe the spot you’re about to fish.</p>

                <h4>Wear A PFD</h4>
                <p class="date">02 Aug 2019</p>
                <p class="content"><p>Fishing the ocean rocks is exciting and incredibly rewarding. It can also be very deadly. We lose so many anglers unnecessarily because of poor decisions made while fishing the ocean rocks. Wear a PFD, (personal floatation device). There are plenty of great designs that allow you to move about and fish unencumbered. It may well save your life.</p>

    <h3>FG Knot</h3>
    <p><span>How to tie the FG Knot.</span> The FG Knot is a popular leader knot with sport fishing skippers in Australia and around the world. It is very strong and once learned it is also an easy and fast method of connecting a leader to your main line. It is absolutely reliable in all classes of line and can be used with mono, braid and fluorocarbon. There are several methods to tie this knot and many of them result in a knot that is considered difficult to tie. This method, popularized by Captain Jason Ehrlich of Australian, makes it easy to tie.</p>
    <p>The key to tying this knot quickly and successfully is to remember to always maintain tension on the lines! Follow the diagrams below and watch the animation and once you tie this knot following these instructions, you can tie it about thirty seconds and will make this your new go-to leader connection knot!</p>

    <h5>FG Knot Tying Instructions</h5>

    <img src="https://www.101knots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Steps-for-Tying-an-FG-Knot.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Open the end of the loop up by going over your index finger and thumb, forming a triangle. You want the lines nice and tight. Bring your middle finger inside where it will be available to help hold the leader as it is passed through the loop.</p>
    <p>In the illustration on the left we have removed the hand to better show the lines but keep the lines as you have them on your hand. Maintain that tension in the braid around the index finger and the thumb. Now take your leader spool and pull off a length that is long enough to run from the spool on the ground, with your foot on it to hold a lot of tension and run it up over your knee. Now feed the end of the line into the loop. Grab the end with your middle finger and hold it, then reach in from the top and grab the line and bring it straight up.</p>
    <p>Wrap the line down one side of the loop, hold with middle finger, then reach in from the top and grab and bring up and then you will wrap down the other side of the loop and grab with middle finger (steps 4, 5, 6, 7).</p>
