Never fish the ocean rocks alone. Again, this is a mistake many experienced anglers make. Tell people exactly where you are going and when you will return. Always try and return when you say you will. If you move spots, call someone and let them know, send a text, it takes no time at all. Remember, fishing the ocean rocks claims many lives every year. These simple precautions are a must as they will likely save your life.
