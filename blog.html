    <h3 class="blog-title">The Absolute Beginner’s Guide to Fishing</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>All you need is a rod, a license, and a good attitude to catch your first fish.</p>

        <p>Fishing may seem complicated to first-time anglers, but that doesn’t have to be the case. With just a bit of gear, a fishing license, and the information in this guide, you’ll be able to get on the water and try your hand at catching some fish by this weekend.</p>
        <p>This guide specifically covers spin fishing, which uses a rod with a spinning reel and lures or live bait to attract fish. For new anglers, it’s one of the easiest ways to get outside with minimal investment, but fly-fishing, saltwater fishing, ice fishing, and other types of gear fishing that utilize different reels are all options that may interest you down the road.</p>
    
        <h5>The Basics</h5>
        <div class="img-box"><img src="https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/img_850-width_flex-height/public/2019/04/11/river-trout_h.jpg?itok=cCO_fB0A" alt=""></div>
        
        <h6>Getting a License</h6>
        <p>Before you head out, make sure you have a current fishing license for the state you’ll be fishing in. Licenses are sold online or at fishing shops and occasionally in convenience stores. The price of a day license is usually fairly inexpensive (less than $20), but the exact price depends on the state and your residency, as fishing licenses cost more for nonresidents. But annual licenses are a better bang for your buck, typically going for between $30 and $150. If nothing disastrous happens your first time (don’t worry, chances are low), you might even want to go again. </p>
    
        <h6>Where Should You Go?</h6>
        <p>It’s always best to talk to a real person about where to fish, as they likely have the most current and comprehensive information about local water. In a pinch, a crowdsourced fishing app like Fishbrain or the more data-heavy FishAngler provides good information on local spots. In general, lakes are a great option when you’re just starting out—they usually have a bank or dock to fish from and often have a larger volume of hungry fish than you would find in a river. Lake fishing mostly involves species like bass, panfish, or rainbow trout, while rivers are almost exclusively fished for salmon or trout species, like rainbow, cutthroat, or brown trout, among others.</p>
    
        <h6>Etiquette</h6>
        <p>It’s important to learn good fishing etiquette early—be respectful of other anglers, the fish you catch, and the environment you’re in. Don’t crowd a spot that someone else is fishing: I like to give other anglers no less than 50 to 60 feet on the most crowded water and more than a couple hundred yards if there aren’t many people around. Don’t keep more fish than you can eat, and always adhere to leave-no-trace ethics. Be sure you know whether the section of the water you’re on is catch and release, limited to artificial lures (no live bait), or fly-fishing only. You can’t always count on a sign to tell you this information, so check a local regulation book or your state’s forestry department’s website for facts as well as updates on closures.</p>
    
        <h5>Gear</h5>

        <p>A spinning reel and rod combo is your best bet as a beginner. “Combo” is the key word here—it signals that the reel and rod are sold together, which usually means they’re easier to set up. Here’s a great video that outlines the basic parts of a spinning reel. An employee at your local tackle shop will be able to point you in the right direction in terms of a good beginner rod that will meet your particular needs.</p>
        <p>Lures and bait will be your next step after a rod and reel. Live worms or PowerBait—a scented puttylike material that you form around a bare hook—are good starting points, while lures, which are decoys designed to attract a fish’s attention, are another effective option once you get comfortable using bait. You’ll also need some bobbers, which are small floating balls that sink or bob when something hits your lure, indicating you have a fish on. A rubber net (which is easier on a fish’s skin than string or nylon nets), needle-nose pliers to retrieve lures from the inside of the fish’s mouth, and a small tackle box to keep all of your lures and bait in one place are also helpful.</p>
        <p>Like any outdoor pursuit, your fishing needs will only continue to expand as you gain more experience; you’ll likely want to upgrade your gear after a few months, while waders and boots could also be added to your kit down the road.</p>
